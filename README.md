Repository for main project in my Software Engineering 1 class

## Added:

- Functions for create session button. Program now is able to open and play youtube videos.
    Note: The current setup causes multiple redundant windows to open over the course of the program.
    These don't play over each other, but it would keep things less cluttered if I could find a way
    to close those windows when done with them.

## To add:

- Function for pause button
- Program makes a chime in the last 3 seconds of a segment
